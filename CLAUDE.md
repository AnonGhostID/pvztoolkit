## Project Guidelines

### Documentation Requirements

-   First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files
-   The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
-   Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan
-   Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go
-   Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity
-   Do not ever change your mind in the middle of act. Just go as planned.
-   Always provide clear reasoning for each decision and code change
-   Ensure nothing breaks
-   Ask for clarification if requirements are ambiguous or unclear
-   Document any assumptions you make during implementation
-   Prioritize code readability and maintainability over cleverness
-   Review your work before marking tasks as complete
-   Do not add some features that not asked just because u want to. 
-   Always use BASH - do not use powershell, except bash command unavailable. always use bash first.
